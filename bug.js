This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `camera.current` property before the component has mounted or the camera has finished initializing.  This often happens when you try to use the camera immediately within the `useEffect` hook without checking if the camera is ready.  Another scenario is incorrectly handling asynchronous operations related to camera access permissions.
